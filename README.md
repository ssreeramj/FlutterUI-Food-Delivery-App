# Curved Design UI

This UI was made just for practice, to get know about widgets in Flutter. The widgets I learnt by making this UI are:
1. Hero
2. AnimatedContainer
3. ListView

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>First Screen</td>
     <td>Second Screen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/firstscreen.jpg" width=270 height=480></td>
    <td><img src="/images/secondscreen.jpg" width=270 height=480></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
